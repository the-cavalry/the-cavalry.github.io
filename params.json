It relies on lightdm for locking and unlocking your session.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Compile-time and run-time configuration.\r\n* Auto starts in the desktop environment.\r\n* Lock the sessions when suspending the machine.\r\n* Timed locking. Automatically lock the session after the screen saver starts.\r\n* Delay VT switching (LightDM greeter) until the first user activity on a timed lock.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
